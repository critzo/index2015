The request must contain a summary of the emergency, along with an explanation of how the information sought will assist law enforcement in addressing the emergency.

Twitter's transparency report (Source 40) states, \"We may not comply with requests for a variety of reasons. For example: We do not comply with requests that fail to identify a Tweet or Twitter account. We may seek to narrow requests that are overly broad. In other cases, users may have challenged the requests after we\u2019ve notified them.\"\n\nElement 8: No evidence found."}], "type": "Internet", "display": "Twitter"}, {"name": "vodafone", "levels": [{"text": "1.

The comment for Element 8 is the same as the group but includes additional information. \n\nElement 1: Vodafone's \"Human Rights and Law Enforcement\" policy standard (source 50, section on \"What is Vodafone's policy?\") explains the company's policy for dealing with non-judicial government requests. The policies are expanded upon in Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54), with a further explanation of policy (p. 8/\u00a7 \"How we work with law enforcement agencies and government authorities\") and principles (p. 9/\u00a7 \"The Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles\").\n\nElement 2: Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p. 12/\u00a7\"Search and seizure powers\") states, \"In most countries, the courts have the power to issue a variety of search and seizure orders in the context of legal proceedings or investigations. Those orders can extend to various forms of customer data, including a company\u2019s business records. The relevant legal powers may be available to members of the public in the course of civil or criminal legal proceedings as well as to a wide range of agencies and authorities.\" This suggests that the Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles (Source 54, p. 9) statement that the company does not \"allow any form of access to any customer data by any agency or authority unless we are legally obliged to do so;\" as well as the rest of its explanation of its process to respond to government requests includes court orders.\n\nElement 3: No disclosure found on how Vodafone deals with private requests for user data.\n\nElement 4: In its 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p.12/ \u00a7 \u201cDisclosure of communications-related data (\u2018metadata\u2019)\u201d), Vodafone states that, \u201cIf an agency or authority wishes to demand access to communications data held abroad on another Vodafone network, they must initiate a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT, also known in Europe as a European Investigatory Order) request \u2013 on a demand-by-demand basis.\u201d It also explains (p. 9, \u00a7 \u201cThe Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles\u201d) that it does not \u201caccept any instruction from any agency or authority acting beyond its jurisdiction or legal mandate.\u201d Vodafone\u2019s 2014 report (source 19, p. 63) was firmer in language and stated that it had received no such demands\u2014which may or may no longer be valid: \u201cDemands for assistance made by agencies or authorities acting beyond their jurisdiction will always be refused, in line with our principles. It is important to note that we have not, in fact, received any such cross-border demands. Were we ever to receive such a demand, in providing our refusal in response, we would inform the agency or authority that they should consider any mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) processes to seek the co- operation of the relevant domestic agency or authority with the necessary lawful mandate.\n\nElement 5: The 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p. 11-12, \u00a7 \"Agency and authority powers: the legal context\") outlines several legal circumstances under which governments may require a company to cooperate by disclosing user information. It also explains a few cases where the company cannot or cannot cooperate, e.g. due to technical reasons. Moreover, its Legal Annexe (source 14) contains a detailed country-by-country breakdown of applicable laws with which Vodafone must comply.\n\nElement 6 (Different from Group comment): Vodafone UK's \"Customer security\" webpage (source 52), section \"Fighting crime\" says, \"Sometimes we\u2019ll share information with the police and security services to help prevent or solve a crime. Requests from the police come through an automated service instead of by phone. It takes just seconds to get the relevant information, which is particularly useful when we\u2019re helping the emergency services identify 999 callers.\" This states that the police can obtain information within seconds. It is unclear whether the company carries out due diligence on such requests, and for this reason, the company does not receive credit on this element. \n\nElement 7: Vodafone's \"Human Rights and Law Enforcement\" policy document (source 50) mentions that \"When a demand is made by a law enforcement authority that does not fall into one of the three exceptions outlined above, we will decline to assist or will challenge the demand in an appropriate manner. In these cases, the matter must be escalated to the governance committee.\" Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report states that it does not, \u201c- allow any form of access to any customer data by any agency or authority unless we are legally obliged to do so; - go beyond what is required under legal due process when responding to demands for access to customer data, other than in specific safety of life emergencies (such as assisting the police with an active kidnapping event) or where refusal to comply would put our employees at risk; or - accept any instruction from any agency or authority acting beyond its jurisdiction or legal mandate.\u201d (source 54, p. 9/\u00a7 \"The Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles\"). The same report (p. 7/\u00a7 \"Security and secrecy: the limits on what local licensed operators can disclose\") mentions that \"While we can \u2013 and do \u2013 challenge demands that are not compliant with legal due process or seem disproportionate, it is however not possible for Vodafone to ascertain the intended purpose of any demand received. Equally, we cannot assess whether or not the information gathered as a result of a demand will be used in a manner which is lawful, nor in most cases can we make any judgment about the potential consequences of complying (or failing to comply) with an individual demand.\"\n\nVodafone's 2014 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report, in contrast, was more explicit (source 19 p. 63) in using 'refuse' rather than 'challenge', as well as detailing reasons for such refusals: \"We can \u2013 and do \u2013 refuse to comply with demands that are unlawful. The majority of rejections tend to be for defects in the legal process or documentation or in response to demands which appear to be issued under an inappropriate legal power. We do not yet have sufficiently robust reporting mechanisms to record all such refusals, so these are not listed in this report. We will consider how best to address this shortcoming where possible, in future reports.\" Nevertheless, Vodafone's disclosure in its 2015 report and the 'human rights and law enforcement' policy document still merits credit on this element.\n\nElement 8: Vodafone gives a few examples that are relevant. In its 2015 report (source 54, section \u201cHow we work with law enforcement agencies and government\u201d), it explains that for complying with user data demands under \u201cEmergency and non-routine assistance\u201d, examples include a police request for assistance while a kidnapping is in progress or to locate a missing child. Similarly, under its \"Discretionary assistance\" header in its Human Rights and Law Enforcement policy (source 50), it gives examples such as harassment, fraud, and stalking as reasons why the company would volunteer (rather than be legally compelled) to give user information to authorities. In addition, \"Customer security\" webpage (source 52), section \"Fighting crime\" provides an example of helping to identify 999 callers.
