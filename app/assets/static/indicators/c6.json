This indicator seeks disclosure that companies have a mechanism specifically designed to address user complaints or concerns about freedom of expression, which is not the same as asking questions. However, other company disclosure provides some evidence of remedy mechanisms. The Help Center contains a section on \"Account Access.\" Twitter's page on \"About suspended accounts\" (Source 78) contains links to pages on users should do when they try to log in see that their account has been locked (Source 87) as well as a form that users can fill out if they would like to appeal an account suspension or locked account (Source 88). With regards to content restriction or removal, Twitter's webpage on \"Flagging media violations in Tweets\" (Source 67) states, \"There is currently no way to appeal a decision by the Twitter team that changes your account setting to Mark media I tweet as containing material that may be sensitive.\" Twitter's webpage on \"Country withheld content\" (Source 26) states that it will notify users if it receives a request to withhold their content, and \"It is up to the user to decide whether to challenge the underlying request. Separately, the user may decide to leave the content online, delete one or more Tweets, or deactivate their Twitter account.\" While this suggests that a remedy process may exist, it provides no further detail on how a user could challenge the request. Twitter's Copyright and DMCA policy (Source 15) explains how users can file a counter-notification if they believe their content has been wrongfully removed for copyright infringement.  Despite these disclosures the lack of clarity on the process to challenge a request to remove content means that the company receives partial credit.\n\nElement 2: No evidence found.\n\nElement 3: The company does provide information on how it responds to  counter-notifications in cases of copyright infringement (Source 15). It also explains how it responds when a user's account has been locked for security purposes or because the company needs confirmation from the account owner (Source 87). However, it does not provide sufficient disclosure on its process to respond to appeals related to requests to remove content or account suspension due to violation of the Twitter Rules. For this reason, the company receives partial credit. \n\nElement 4: Twitter's transparency report (which includes Vine and Periscope), section on copyright notices (Source 44) does include data on the number of DMCA counter notices it receives, percentage of materials restored, tweets affected, and media affected.
