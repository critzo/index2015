WeChat also has a separate privacy policy for users outside of mainland China (Source 22-Traditional Chinese version, Source 23-English version). Notably, these policies (Sources 22, 23) feature the TRUSTe seal while Tencent\u2019s Privacy Policy (Source 6) does not.\n\nElement A: No evidence found.\n\nElement B1: The privacy policy that applies to users outside mainland China (Sources 22, 23) define information as personal information and non-personal information. It defines personal information to include log data, location data and public information and defines non-personal information as, \"any information that relates to you but from which it is not practicable to directly or indirectly identify you, including Personal Information in aggregated, anonymised or pseudonymised form.\" However, it does not provide additional detail on how it anonymizes or pseudonymises information. The policy states that the company shares personal information with third parties and shares non-personal information with advertisers. It defines \"shared information as \"is information about you or relating to you that is voluntarily shared on our services, including postings that you make on our services (including your public profile, the lists you create), any postings from others that you re-post and including Location Data and Log Data associated with these postings. Shared Information also includes information about you (including Location Data and Log Data) that others who are using our services share about you.\" It issues this explanation about shared information: \"A number of our services enable Shared Information to be shared publicly with all users of that service and not just your contacts. Our social media services in particular are primarily designed to help you share Shared Information with the world, so Shared Information can be broadly and instantly transmitted and will remain public for as long as you do not delete it (and even after you delete Shared Information, it may still be separately cached, copied, or stored by, or remain public through, other users or third parties who are not affiliated with and not controlled by us).\" The policy that applies to users in mainland China (Source 6) contains similar disclosure, though it is unclear if this policy's definition of personal information includes location and log data. In addition, this version of the policy does not define non-personally identifiable information, stating that the company may share non-personally identifiable information collected through cookies or web beacons with advertisers or other partners. Given the lack of clarity in both policies around what non-personally identifiable data the company shares, the company receives partial credit.\n\nElement B2: The privacy policy that applies to users outside mainland China (Sources 22, 23) states that the company shares personal information \"for the purposes of: (i) providing our services to you; (ii) assisting us in carrying out the purposes set out under the \u201cHow We Use Your Information\u201d section above; (iii) carrying out our obligations and enforcing our rights under the WeChat Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy; and/or (iv) help understand and improve our services.
