Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report - Updated Legal Annexe February 2015 (Source 14) provides a country-by-country break down of relevant laws. However, the disclosure does not clearly compare jurisdictional laws to international human rights standards. Nevertheless, a gap analysis completed in 2013/14 by Vodafone and Business for Social Responsibility compared Vodafone's group-level approach to human rights against the UN Guiding Principles. This review identifies freedom of expression and privacy as a relevant category for Vodafone (Source 40, pg. 118).\n\nElement 2: Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (Source 40, p.65, Under the \u201cUnderstanding and responding to risks\u201d heading) states that Vodafone conducts \u201cregular formal reviews of the most significant privacy and security risks affecting our business at Group level\u201d. This statement does not specify whether Vodafone's reviews include regular assessments of existing products and services. For this reason, the company does not meet the requirements for \"Yes,\" but it receives partial credit on Privacy. Further, while being relatively clear that \"privacy and security risks\" are part of the review, it is not clear whether freedom of expression is explicitly considered. As such, no credit is assessed on Freedom of Expression. \n\nElement 3: Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (Source 40, p. 65) states that Vodafone's Global Advisory Forum \"brings together a cross-functional group of experts from across Vodafone Group to provide input on potential new products, services and technologies, ensuring that privacy and freedom of expression are taken into account at the earliest stage of the design process\". Additionally, privacy impact assessments are a key component of this process and of its Privacy Risk Management System, which ensures PIAs are done when new products/services are developed in local markets. Notably, Vodafone reports that in 2014/15, its local markets conducted 425 PIAs (Source 40, pg. 63). The group further conducted an \u201cinternal strategic review\u201d of its cloud services to \u201censure a consistent global approach to cloud privacy and security, whether for our internal use or for our customers\u201d.\n\nElement 4: No evidence found.\n\nElement 5: Vodafone's 2013/14 Sustainability Report (Source 19, p.51, \u201cIn focus: Vodafone Privacy Risk Management System\u201d box) has two bullets that speak to this element: \u201cCritical privacy risk management\u201d and \u201cReview and reporting\u201d.
