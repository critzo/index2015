The comments below refer to Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54) unless otherwise noted.\n\nElement 1: In its Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p. 21-27 / \u00a7 'Country-by-country disclosure'), Vodafone provides a country-by-country breakdown of real-time communication demands as well as demands for accessing stored 'communications data'. This overview is intended to, \"disclose the aggregate number of demands [Vodafone] received during 2014\u201315 in each of [its] countries of operation unless prohibited from doing so or unless a government or other public body already discloses information on an industry-wide basis\" (p. 4 / \u00a7 \"What we are publishing, and why\"). As mentioned, publication restrictions can be legal, however, the company also states that it has chosen not release information in cases where other local operators and/or governments in fact do so (e.g., Australia, Germany, Greece and the UK). Vodafone's justifications for this choice include a desire to not confuse readers of the data as well as to encourage government transparency. (p. 5-6 / \u00a7 \"Who should publish: governments or operators?\", p. 7 / \u00a7 \"Security and secrecy: the limits on what local licensed operators can disclose\", p. 20 / \u00a7 \"Explanation of the information presented\"). However, since the report contains no data on requests from the United Kingdom, the company does not receive credit for this element.\n\nElement 2: The company does not list the number of accounts affected. It explains, \"We believe that the only genuinely meaningful statistic would be the number of individual people who had been targeted by agency and authority demands over a given period, typically one year. However, for the reasons explained below, that statistic is not visible even to an individual operator with respect to their own customers, let alone across the industry as a whole.\" (p. 5-6 / \u00a7 \"Who should publish: governments or operators?\"); and \"In our view, given the inherent difficulty of drawing reliable conclusions from statistics related to target numbers, the most robust metric available is the number of times an agency or authority demand for assistance is instigated\", \"We therefore believe that disclosure of the number of individual warrants served in a year is currently the least ambiguous and most meaningful statistic when seeking to ensure public transparency.\" (p. 6, \u00a7 \"What statistics should be reported: warrants or targets?\").\n\nElement 3: Vodafone\u2019s transparency report disclosures are broken down between requests for lawful intercept and communications data. Vodafone clarifies throughout the report that its disclosure covers lawful intercept, which is content data, and \u201ccommunications data\u201d, which is non-content. \n\nElement 4: Vodafone's February 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report Legal Annexe (Source 14) provides extensive explanations of relevant legal authorities in its operating countries, but it does not specify which requests came from which authorities or through which process. For this reason, the company receives partial credit.\n\nElement 5: Vodafone does not make clear if the 'law enforcement' numbers disclosed in its report include court orders. The report does mention that courts can make demands for customer data: \"In most countries, the courts have the power to issue a variety of search and seizure orders in the context of legal proceedings or investigations. Those orders can extend to various forms of customer data, including a company\u2019s business records. The relevant legal powers may be available to members of the public in the course of civil or criminal legal proceedings as well as to a wide range of agencies and authorities.\" (source 54, p. 12 \"Search and seizure powers\")\n\nElement 6: There is no evidence that Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report addresses non-governmental requests.\n\nElement 7: Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report only reports on number of demands received, not how many requests the company complied with. (p. 20, \u00a7 \"Explanation of the information presented\").\n\nElement 8: The company includes extensive information on what types of government demands it is unable to disclose, separated out per country, and citing relevant laws (source 14 (complete source), and source 54, p. 4-5 / \u00a7 \"The transparency challenge\", p. 7 / \u00a7 \"Security and secrecy: the limits on what local licensed operators can disclose\", p. 21-27 / \u00a7 \"Country-by-country disclosure\").\n\nElement 9: Vodafone releases this information once per year (for the first time in June 2014, the second time in July 2015).\n\nElement 10: The data in the Law Enforcement Disclosure Report cannot be exported as a structured data file."}], "type": "Telecommunications", "display": "Vodafone"}, {"name": "yahoo", "levels": [{"text": "1.
