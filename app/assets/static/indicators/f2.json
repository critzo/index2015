In case of changes to the actual terms, there is no mention of how customers may potentially be notified about such changes.\n\nThe Red+ TOS (source 35 \u00a713) says \"We may vary or amend these terms from time to time, but if it\u2019s to your disadvantage, we\u2019ll give you at least 14 days\u2019 notice of such a change,\" but this does not specify the method of notifying users. The mobile broadband TOS (source 32) does not contain any information about direct notification. \n\nBased on this disclosure, It is not clear that mobile users will receive direct notification from the company regarding changes to the TOS. As such, no credit is evaluated here.  \n\nElement 2: The Pay as you Go ToS (source 33, \u00a77) contains no specific time period for notification: \"We may make changes to or withdraw services at any time and we can make changes to or introduce new terms to this agreement at anytime. If possible we will give reasonable notice of these changes.\"\n\nThe Pay Monthly ToS (source 34, \u00a77) explains that \"We may change or withdraw services at any time and we may change or introduce new terms  to this agreement at any time. If we do, we'll give you at least 30  days' notice of these changes unless we believe such changes will not  disadvantage you or which you don't regularly use.\" The Red+ TOS (source 35 \u00a713) says \"We may vary or amend these terms from time to time, but if it\u2019s to your disadvantage, we\u2019ll give you at least 14 days\u2019 notice of such a change.\" Although these disclosures specify a time period, they state the user will only receive notification in situations where the company decides it is necessary. \n\nThe mobile broadband via the phone (source 32) document does not include information about when a customer may be informed about changes.\n\nGiven the lack of clear commitment to always inform customers within a certain time period, no credit is evaluated here.\n\nElement 3: The Vodafone UK page on \"Terms and Conditions\" (Source 2) contains a section for \"Previous Terms and Conditions.\" However it is unclear how the documents are organized. The Pay as you Go (source 33) and pay monthly (source 34) have archived versions available. For Red+ (source 35), even though the document indicates it is a latest version, no previous version is provided. No previous version of the mobile broadband is provided, though it is unclear whether the current version of the policy is the only version. Since two of the four TOS documents reviewed here are not in the archive, the company receives partial credit.
