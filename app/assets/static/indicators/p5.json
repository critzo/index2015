The bottom of the notice contains a link to the form that users are required to fill out for this process. The Code of Business Practices contains similar language, though it does not provide the link to the relevant form. Instead, it directs users to the Telcel website for the form (source 17, p. 86, \"MEDIOS PARA EJERCER LOS DERECHOS DE ACCESO, RECTIFICACI\u00d3N, CANCELACI\u00d3N U OPOSICI\u00d3N Y REVOVACI\u00d3N DEL CONSENTIMIENTO\u201d) Despite being linked to the Privacy Notice, this form is not easy to locate on the website.

Telcel's Privacy Notice provides that users can follow the same process outlined in element 1 to limit the sharing of their personal information, \"limitar el uso o divulgaci\u00f3n de sus datos personales.\" However, the second paragraph of the section suggests that users can only prevent their information from being used to send them promotions, and not for other uses. Specifically, the notice states, \"En caso de que su solicitud resulte procedente, el Departamento de Datos Personales de Telcel lo registrar\u00e1 en el listado de exclusi\u00f3n propio de Telcel con el objeto de que usted deje de recibir nuestras promociones.\" (source 12, p. 2-3, \"Opciones y medios para limitar el uso o divulgaci\u00f3n de sus datos personales\") Since it is not clear whether this constitutes an option to control the company's sharing of user information, and there is no evidence that users have options to control other types of sharing, the company does not receive credit for this element."}], "type": "Telecommunications", "display": "America Movil"}, {"name": "at&t", "levels": [{"text": "1.
