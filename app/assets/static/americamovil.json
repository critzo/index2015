Specifically, the policy says it collects, \"a) Sus datos personales de identificaci\u00f3n, contacto, referencias, profesionales, financieros y/o patrimoniales, b) Los datos de identificaci\u00f3n y contacto de las personas que usted haya designado como referencias. Al proporcionar estos datos usted reconoce tener el consentimiento de dichas personas para el tratamiento de sus datos con fines de contacto y/o cobranza y/o para realizar investigaciones y monitoreos peri\u00f3dicos respecto de su historial crediticio.\" It states it does not collect sensitive personal data but doesn't explain what this includes. The section \"Descripci\u00f3n de los Servicios\" also says that Telcel collects technical information about users' access or use of the services, including IMEI data or serial numbers of equipment as well as the date, time, and duration of accessing services and transmitting data. Specifically, the policy says it collects, \"informaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica relativa al acceso y/o uso de los Servicios, entre la que se encuentra comprendida el IMEI o n\u00famero de serie del equipo terminal, as\u00ed como la fecha, hora y duraci\u00f3n de acceso a servicios de transmisi\u00f3n de datos.\" Similarly, while the Code of Business Practice provides list of types of data Telcel collects, some of the categories are vague, saying it collects all information the user provides as part of the established contractual or commercial relationship...including other data that is collected from time to time as part of the provision of services, as required by law, or mandated by a competent authority, or through other avenues permitted by law. Specifically, the policy says it collects \"(ii) toda aquella informaci\u00f3n que el usuario le ha proporcionado y/o le proporcione a lo largo de la relaci\u00f3n contractual o comercial que establezcan...(v) as\u00ed como cualesquiera otros datos que se recaben de tiempo en tiempo con motivo de la prestaci\u00f3n de los Servicios, por ministerio de ley, por mandamiento de autoridad competente o a trav\u00e9s de otras fuentes que est\u00e1n permitidas por la ley.\" (source 17, p. 85, DATOS PERSONALES QUE RECABA TELCEL). In addition, the code says that all personal information that identifies the user, disclosed directly or through another method of contact or online public forum, can be collected and processed by Telcel. Specifically, the policy says, \"Toda informaci\u00f3n personal que identifica al usuario, revelada de manera directa o por cualquier medio de contacto y/o foro p\u00fablico de conexi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea, podr\u00e1 ser recopilada y tratada por Telcel.\u201d This sentence is extremely vague. While the company discloses the types of information it collects through use of the service, its disclosure on other types of information the company collects is not clear at all. For this reason, the company receives partial credit. \n\nElement B3: Telcel's Privacy Notice discloses that the company collects data when users provide it and that it collects information automatically through use of the service, including through use of cookies. However, the policy also states that it collects information through any means of contact or connection to a public forum (\"La informaci\u00f3n antes se\u00f1alada es proporcionada voluntariamente por usted de manera directa o por cualquier medio de contacto y/o foro p\u00fablico de conexi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea relacionados...\").

The bottom of the notice contains a link to the form that users are required to fill out for this process. The Code of Business Practices contains similar language, though it does not provide the link to the relevant form. Instead, it directs users to the Telcel website for the form (source 17, p. 86, \"MEDIOS PARA EJERCER LOS DERECHOS DE ACCESO, RECTIFICACI\u00d3N, CANCELACI\u00d3N U OPOSICI\u00d3N Y REVOVACI\u00d3N DEL CONSENTIMIENTO\u201d) Despite being linked to the Privacy Notice, this form is not easy to locate on the website.

For this reason, the company receives partial credit. \n\nElement 2: According to the DLA Piper explanation of Mexico's data protection law, which includes the ARCO process, \"Domestic or international transfers of personal data may be carried out without the consent of the data subject\" provided the third party follows a set of conditions listed in the document (source 22, p. 4, \"Transfer\"). Telcel's Privacy Notice provides that users can follow the same process outlined in element 1 to limit the sharing of their personal information, \"limitar el uso o divulgaci\u00f3n de sus datos personales.\" However, the second paragraph of the section suggests that users can only prevent their information from being used to send them promotions, and not for other uses.
