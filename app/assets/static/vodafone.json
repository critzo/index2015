Our review was limited to assessing whether relevant policies and procedures are in place and did not extend to assessing Vodafone\u2019s implementation or effectiveness of these within the business.\" On this basis there is no evidence that the assurance included looking at actual impact assessments as conducted by Vodafone, and as a consequence the company receives no credit for this element.\n\nElement 9: No evidence found. "}, {"sources": "14, 19, 40", "score": "61.11", "type": "", "name": "Mobile", "comments": "Element 1: It is clear that the company examines laws affecting privacy and FOE in jurisdictions where it operates. Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report - Updated Legal Annexe February 2015 (Source 14) provides a country-by-country break down of relevant laws. However, the disclosure does not clearly compare jurisdictional laws to international human rights standards. Nevertheless, a gap analysis completed in 2013/14 by Vodafone and Business for Social Responsibility compared Vodafone's group-level approach to human rights against the UN Guiding Principles. This review identifies freedom of expression and privacy as a relevant category for Vodafone (Source 40, pg. 118).\n\nElement 2: Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (Source 40, p.65, Under the \u201cUnderstanding and responding to risks\u201d heading) states that Vodafone conducts \u201cregular formal reviews of the most significant privacy and security risks affecting our business at Group level\u201d. This statement does not specify whether Vodafone's reviews include regular assessments of existing products and services. For this reason, the company does not meet the requirements for \"Yes,\" but it receives partial credit on Privacy. Further, while being relatively clear that \"privacy and security risks\" are part of the review, it is not clear whether freedom of expression is explicitly considered. As such, no credit is assessed on Freedom of Expression. \n\nElement 3: Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (Source 40, p. 65) states that Vodafone's Global Advisory Forum \"brings together a cross-functional group of experts from across Vodafone Group to provide input on potential new products, services and technologies, ensuring that privacy and freedom of expression are taken into account at the earliest stage of the design process\". Additionally, privacy impact assessments are a key component of this process and of its Privacy Risk Management System, which ensures PIAs are done when new products/services are developed in local markets. Notably, Vodafone reports that in 2014/15, its local markets conducted 425 PIAs (Source 40, pg. 63). The group further conducted an \u201cinternal strategic review\u201d of its cloud services to \u201censure a consistent global approach to cloud privacy and security, whether for our internal use or for our customers\u201d.\n\nElement 4: No evidence found.\n\nElement 5: Vodafone's 2013/14 Sustainability Report (Source 19, p.51, \u201cIn focus: Vodafone Privacy Risk Management System\u201d box) has two bullets that speak to this element: \u201cCritical privacy risk management\u201d and \u201cReview and reporting\u201d. These descriptions are not repeated in the 2014/15 sustainability report, but credit has been given based on the earlier disclosure and the understanding that the Privacy Risk Management System continues to operate in 2015. \n\"Critical privacy risk management: Processes for ensuring that strategies and policies developed to address critical privacy risks are effectively implemented\"\n\"Review and reporting: Processes to ensure that all the above are reviewed and reported to executive management, with identified improvements included in business plans.\"\n\nElement 6: Vodafone's 2013/14 Sustainability Report (Source 19, p.121) says, \u201cIn 2013/14, we further strengthened our human rights impact assessment process for potential new markets identified as high risk. These findings are considered in the decision-making process before entering a new market\u201d. As of 2015, a similar statement was not reiterated. However, the board does take oversight of sustainability, of which privacy and security and human rights were among the top themes, so the company receives credit for this element.  In addition, Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (source 40, pg. 59) says Vodafone\u2019s network traffic management prohibits use of network technologies that inspect data packets for any reason beyond lawful traffic management. Any inspection of data packets outside of these uses must be preceded by an \u201cin-depth privacy impact assessment\u201d and receive authorisation by a senior executive at the group level. \n\nElement 7: As a signatory to the Telecom Industry Dialogue, Vodafone commits to conduct regular HRIAs. However, as of 2015, evidence did not confirm whether HRIAs concerning freedom of expression are conducted on a regular schedule. For this reason, the company receives None/No evidence for FOE on element 7. Regarding privacy, Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (Source 40, p.65, Under the \u201cUnderstanding and responding to risks\u201d heading) states, \"regular formal reviews of the most significant privacy and security risks affecting our business at Group, and strategies to respond to the most critical risks,\" so it does seem reasonable that a privacy-specific process is conducted regularly. For this reason, the company receives credit for Element 7 on privacy.\n\nElement 8: Vodafone's 2014/15 Sustainability Report (Source 40, p. 67) states that Vodafone's Industry Dialogue Update received assurance from EY. In its assurance statement, EY explains that \"As part of our scope in 2014/15 we reviewed Vodafone\u2019s statement of alignment with the Telecommunications Industry Dialogue Guiding Principles on freedom of expression and privacy. Our review was limited to assessing whether relevant policies and procedures are in place and did not extend to assessing Vodafone\u2019s implementation or effectiveness of these within the business.\" On this basis there is no evidence that the assurance included looking at actual impact assessments as conducted by Vodafone, and as a consequence the company receives no credit for this element.\n\nElement 9: No evidence found.

For this reason, the company receives partial credit. In its Freedom of Expression principles (p. 16, \u00a7The Vodafone freedom of expression principles\"), Vodafone explains that it believes governments should \"ensure their citizens are made aware whenever access to specific content has been blocked for legal reasons, for example by permitting telecommunications operators and service providers to supply an online \u2018splash page\u2019 instead of a simple \u2018404 page not found\u2019 error message.\"\n\nElement 3: Whlie Vodafone UK's page on, \"Keeping Children Safe,\" (Source 56) states that users who attempt to visit a site that the IWF has identified as illegal will see a warning \"that their activity is potentially illegal\", the notification does not substantially provide the user with an understanding of why the page has been blocked including, for instance, some detail on the legal violation in question or the authority or law dictating the restriction.

The third guiding principle reads \"Create operational processes and routines to evaluate and handle government requests that may have an impact on freedom of expression and privacy.\" (source 47). Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (Source 54, p. 15) lists the Vodafone freedom of expression principles. This includes a list of \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" with regard to how the company approaches government requests, which constitutes an explanation of its process.\n\nElement 2: Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (Source 54, p. 14) discusses how courts can order content restriction, stating, \"For example, a court can issue an order related to the infringement of intellectual property rights or defamatory material. This implies the company's disclosure in element 1 applies to court orders.\n\nElement 3: Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (Source 54, p. 16) states that the company restricts content \"undertaken under the IWF [Internet Watch Foundation] or equivalent schemes that are designed to prevent access to illegal online child abuse material.\" However, it does not specify its process for reviewing such requests. In its sustainability report, the company further clarifies its relationship with IWF and commitment to blocking child abuse content. The company states that when this type of content it identified on its servers it has notice and takedown procedures in place to work toward making sure that the content is removed and flagged to law enforcement for further investigation. In terms of restriction content or service, Vodafone otherwise states in its freedom of expression principles in its law enforcement report the kinds of blocking of content (and accounts) that it will do. Specifically, the company states that blocking only occurs when: an agency or authority makes a lawful request; blocking access to illegal online child abuse material under the Internet Watch Foundation or equivalent; instructed voluntarily by the customer directly via parental controls software or other user-defined filters; or \"undertaken to protect the integrity of our customers\u2019 data, manage traffic or prevent network degradation, for example blocking spam or malware or taking action to prevent denial of service hacker attacks.\u201d \n\nElement 4: Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (Source 54, p, 15) states, \"As our legal annexe shows, the circumstances under which agencies and authorities can use their legal powers to require us to block or restrict access to our network or to online services and content vary greatly from country to country. Defining a set of robust and meaningful principles that can feasibly be put into practice across all of Vodafone\u2019s operating companies worldwide is, therefore, a significant challenge. There are wide disparities in legislation between countries and cultures and even between neighbouring member states within the European Union which are closely aligned in many other ways.\" This suggests that the process laid out in its freedomof expression principles (p. 15-16) applies to requests from foreign governments.\n\nElement 5: Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report - Updated Legal Annexe February 2015 (Source 14) provides a country-by-country breakdown of the laws with which the company must comply.\n\nElement 6-7: Vodafone's Freedom of Expression principles (Source 54, p. 15) state that the company does \"seek to challenge agency or authority demands that appear to us to be overly broad, insufficiently targeted or disproportionate in nature.\" and does not \"go beyond what is required under legal due process when responding to demands other than where refusal to comply would put our employees at risk.\"\n\nElement 8: Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report offers insight into how policy is implemented, including technical methods of implementing blocking requests (source 54, p. 17, \u00a7 How access to communications is blocked or restricted)."}], "follow": 0, "id": "F6"}, {"levels": [{"text": "1.

The relevant legal powers may be available to members of the public in the course of civil or criminal legal proceedings as well as to a wide range of agencies and authorities.\" This suggests that the Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles (Source 54, p. 9) statement that the company does not \"allow any form of access to any customer data by any agency or authority unless we are legally obliged to do so;\" as well as the rest of its explanation of its process to respond to government requests includes court orders.\n\nElement 3: No disclosure found on how Vodafone deals with private requests for user data.\n\nElement 4: In its 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p.12/ \u00a7 \u201cDisclosure of communications-related data (\u2018metadata\u2019)\u201d), Vodafone states that, \u201cIf an agency or authority wishes to demand access to communications data held abroad on another Vodafone network, they must initiate a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT, also known in Europe as a European Investigatory Order) request \u2013 on a demand-by-demand basis.\u201d It also explains (p. 9, \u00a7 \u201cThe Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles\u201d) that it does not \u201caccept any instruction from any agency or authority acting beyond its jurisdiction or legal mandate.\u201d Vodafone\u2019s 2014 report (source 19, p. 63) was firmer in language and stated that it had received no such demands\u2014which may or may no longer be valid: \u201cDemands for assistance made by agencies or authorities acting beyond their jurisdiction will always be refused, in line with our principles. It is important to note that we have not, in fact, received any such cross-border demands. Were we ever to receive such a demand, in providing our refusal in response, we would inform the agency or authority that they should consider any mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) processes to seek the co- operation of the relevant domestic agency or authority with the necessary lawful mandate.\n\nElement 5: The 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p. 11-12, \u00a7 \"Agency and authority powers: the legal context\") outlines several legal circumstances under which governments may require a company to cooperate by disclosing user information. It also explains a few cases where the company cannot or cannot cooperate, e.g. due to technical reasons. Moreover, its Legal Annexe (source 14) contains a detailed country-by-country breakdown of applicable laws with which Vodafone must comply.\n\nElement 6 (Different from Group comment): Vodafone UK's \"Customer security\" webpage (source 52), section \"Fighting crime\" says, \"Sometimes we\u2019ll share information with the police and security services to help prevent or solve a crime. Requests from the police come through an automated service instead of by phone. It takes just seconds to get the relevant information, which is particularly useful when we\u2019re helping the emergency services identify 999 callers.\" This states that the police can obtain information within seconds. It is unclear whether the company carries out due diligence on such requests, and for this reason, the company does not receive credit on this element. \n\nElement 7: Vodafone's \"Human Rights and Law Enforcement\" policy document (source 50) mentions that \"When a demand is made by a law enforcement authority that does not fall into one of the three exceptions outlined above, we will decline to assist or will challenge the demand in an appropriate manner. In these cases, the matter must be escalated to the governance committee.\" Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report states that it does not, \u201c- allow any form of access to any customer data by any agency or authority unless we are legally obliged to do so; - go beyond what is required under legal due process when responding to demands for access to customer data, other than in specific safety of life emergencies (such as assisting the police with an active kidnapping event) or where refusal to comply would put our employees at risk; or - accept any instruction from any agency or authority acting beyond its jurisdiction or legal mandate.\u201d (source 54, p. 9/\u00a7 \"The Vodafone privacy and law enforcement principles\"). The same report (p. 7/\u00a7 \"Security and secrecy: the limits on what local licensed operators can disclose\") mentions that \"While we can \u2013 and do \u2013 challenge demands that are not compliant with legal due process or seem disproportionate, it is however not possible for Vodafone to ascertain the intended purpose of any demand received. Equally, we cannot assess whether or not the information gathered as a result of a demand will be used in a manner which is lawful, nor in most cases can we make any judgment about the potential consequences of complying (or failing to comply) with an individual demand.\"\n\nVodafone's 2014 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report, in contrast, was more explicit (source 19 p. 63) in using 'refuse' rather than 'challenge', as well as detailing reasons for such refusals: \"We can \u2013 and do \u2013 refuse to comply with demands that are unlawful. The majority of rejections tend to be for defects in the legal process or documentation or in response to demands which appear to be issued under an inappropriate legal power. We do not yet have sufficiently robust reporting mechanisms to record all such refusals, so these are not listed in this report. We will consider how best to address this shortcoming where possible, in future reports.\" Nevertheless, Vodafone's disclosure in its 2015 report and the 'human rights and law enforcement' policy document still merits credit on this element.\n\nElement 8: Vodafone gives a few examples that are relevant. In its 2015 report (source 54, section \u201cHow we work with law enforcement agencies and government\u201d), it explains that for complying with user data demands under \u201cEmergency and non-routine assistance\u201d, examples include a police request for assistance while a kidnapping is in progress or to locate a missing child. Similarly, under its \"Discretionary assistance\" header in its Human Rights and Law Enforcement policy (source 50), it gives examples such as harassment, fraud, and stalking as reasons why the company would volunteer (rather than be legally compelled) to give user information to authorities. In addition, \"Customer security\" webpage (source 52), section \"Fighting crime\" provides an example of helping to identify 999 callers. "}], "follow": 0, "id": "P9"}, {"levels": [{"text": "1.

The comments below refer to Vodafone's 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54) unless otherwise noted.\n\nElement 1: In its Law Enforcement Disclosure Report (source 54, p. 21-27 / \u00a7 'Country-by-country disclosure'), Vodafone provides a country-by-country breakdown of real-time communication demands as well as demands for accessing stored 'communications data'. This overview is intended to, \"disclose the aggregate number of demands [Vodafone] received during 2014\u201315 in each of [its] countries of operation unless prohibited from doing so or unless a government or other public body already discloses information on an industry-wide basis\" (p. 4 / \u00a7 \"What we are publishing, and why\"). As mentioned, publication restrictions can be legal, however, the company also states that it has chosen not release information in cases where other local operators and/or governments in fact do so (e.g., Australia, Germany, Greece and the UK). Vodafone's justifications for this choice include a desire to not confuse readers of the data as well as to encourage government transparency. (p. 5-6 / \u00a7 \"Who should publish: governments or operators?\", p. 7 / \u00a7 \"Security and secrecy: the limits on what local licensed operators can disclose\", p. 20 / \u00a7 \"Explanation of the information presented\"). However, since the report contains no data on requests from the United Kingdom, the company does not receive credit for this element.\n\nElement 2: The company does not list the number of accounts affected. It explains, \"We believe that the only genuinely meaningful statistic would be the number of individual people who had been targeted by agency and authority demands over a given period, typically one year. However, for the reasons explained below, that statistic is not visible even to an individual operator with respect to their own customers, let alone across the industry as a whole.\" (p. 5-6 / \u00a7 \"Who should publish: governments or operators?\"); and \"In our view, given the inherent difficulty of drawing reliable conclusions from statistics related to target numbers, the most robust metric available is the number of times an agency or authority demand for assistance is instigated\", \"We therefore believe that disclosure of the number of individual warrants served in a year is currently the least ambiguous and most meaningful statistic when seeking to ensure public transparency.\" (p. 6, \u00a7 \"What statistics should be reported: warrants or targets?\").\n\nElement 3: Vodafone\u2019s transparency report disclosures are broken down between requests for lawful intercept and communications data. Vodafone clarifies throughout the report that its disclosure covers lawful intercept, which is content data, and \u201ccommunications data\u201d, which is non-content. \n\nElement 4: Vodafone's February 2015 Law Enforcement Disclosure Report Legal Annexe (Source 14) provides extensive explanations of relevant legal authorities in its operating countries, but it does not specify which requests came from which authorities or through which process. For this reason, the company receives partial credit.\n\nElement 5: Vodafone does not make clear if the 'law enforcement' numbers disclosed in its report include court orders. The report does mention that courts can make demands for customer data: \"In most countries, the courts have the power to issue a variety of search and seizure orders in the context of legal proceedings or investigations. Those orders can extend to various forms of customer data, including a company\u2019s business records. The relevant legal powers may be available to members of the public in the course of civil or criminal legal proceedings as well as to a wide range of agencies and authorities.\" (source 54, p. 12 \"Search and seizure powers\")\n\nElement 6: There is no evidence that Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report addresses non-governmental requests.\n\nElement 7: Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report only reports on number of demands received, not how many requests the company complied with. (p. 20, \u00a7 \"Explanation of the information presented\").\n\nElement 8: The company includes extensive information on what types of government demands it is unable to disclose, separated out per country, and citing relevant laws (source 14 (complete source), and source 54, p. 4-5 / \u00a7 \"The transparency challenge\", p. 7 / \u00a7 \"Security and secrecy: the limits on what local licensed operators can disclose\", p. 21-27 / \u00a7 \"Country-by-country disclosure\").\n\nElement 9: Vodafone releases this information once per year (for the first time in June 2014, the second time in July 2015).\n\nElement 10: The data in the Law Enforcement Disclosure Report cannot be exported as a structured data file."}], "follow": 0, "id": "P11"}, {"levels": [{"text": "1.

We also recognise that if things do go wrong, we need to act quickly and openly to protect our customers.
