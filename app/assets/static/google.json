Without this information, we will be unable to take action on your request:\" However, this does not explain how the company reviews and responds to requests. For this reason, the company receives partial credit. \n\nElement 4: Yes, Google\u2019s explanation of its process to respond to government requests references foreign requests. In the main \"Transparency Removals Government\" document (Source 20) it states in the first paragraph that \u201cWe regularly receive requests from courts and government agencies around the world to remove information from Google products\u2026.We closely review these requests to determine if content should be removed because it violates a law or our product policies.\u201d It also provides examples of requests it has received from other governments. \n\nElement 5: Yes, with regard to government requests, the \"Transparency Removals Government\" document (Source 20) states, \"Governments ask us to remove or review content for many different reasons. For example, some requests allege defamation, while others claim that content violates local laws prohibiting hate speech or adult content. The laws surrounding these issues vary by country.\" In the transparency data, the company categorizes these requests by defamation, obscenity/nudity, privacy/security, or other, with further detail in the per-country breakdowns. It also acknowledges that some governments might use these laws to request removal of political speech. \n\nElement 6: Yes, the \"Transparency Removals Government\" document (Source 20) section \"How requests are made and processed\" states, \u201cWe always assess the legitimacy and completeness of a government request.\" YouTube's Copyright FAQ (Source 114) states, \"Why did YouTube ask for more information regarding my copyright request? Copyright takedowns are formal, legal requests that require specific elements in order to be complete and actionable. When we receive an incomplete or otherwise invalid copyright request -- be it a takedown notification or a counter notification -- we respond with information that will help the sender complete their request. If you received a response like this following your submission of a copyright request, it is important to review it carefully and respond accordingly. In most cases, we won\u2019t be able to take action on your request until you do so.\n\nElement 7: Yes, the \"Transparency Removals Government\" document (Source 20) section \"How requests are made and processed\" states that, \"We always assess the legitimacy and completeness of a government request....There are many reasons why we might not remove content in response to a request. For example, some requests might not be specific enough for us to know what the government wants us to remove. In these cases, we ask for more information. Sometimes we don\u2019t comply with requests because the content has already been removed by the content owner.\" In addition, it adds that it will not take action on \"incomplete or otherwise invalid copyright requests\" \n\nElement 8: Yes, the document \"Explore requests\" (Source 27) contains more than 20 examples of government requests.
