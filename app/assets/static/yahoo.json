When issues or questions arise related to such things as the enforcement of our terms of service, we may refer to our HRIAs, which contain information on high-level principles and guidelines, as well as guidance for decision-making.\" While this shows the company considers the human rights implications of its terms of service encforcement processes and mechanisms, which is laudable, this element seeks disclosure that the HRIA process itself includes a review of such enforcement practices. Since it is unclear whether Yahoo's HRIAs include assessment of such processes, the company receives partial credit. \n\nElement 5: In the GNI 2010 annual report (Source 51), Yahoo's self-assessment states that if it identifies significant risks to users\u2019 free expression and/or privacy, it undertakes a long-form assessment.\n\nElement 6: The GNI Assessment Report (Source 55) states that within the company, \u201cThe BHRP reports to the Deputy General Counsel/VP of Global Public Policy, who in turn reports to the General Counsel/Board Secretary and provides regular reports and briefings  to the Board executive management.\u201d\n\nElement 7: Yahoo's BHRP page (Source 56) indicates what would trigger an HRIA, demonstrating that HRIAs are not a one-time occurrence for the company.
